## 🧐 What?
"Beat 2022 European Crises" is a short name for the project titled "**Detect and estimate occupancy via IoT-enabled air quality sensor with machine learning** – a potential privacy-preserving approach to deal with looming Covid-19 waves and winter gas shortage".
(introduction, abstract, co scope)
## 🤷 Why?  
Given the energy crisis facing European countries in the heat of summer 2022, and the looming Covid-19 waves in winter, occupancy monitoring based on non-intrusive approaches has potentials to help schools and public building owners deal with all regulatory changes. This is a new application that has not been deployed in practice.
## ⚒️ How?  
Data collections of occupancy, indoor air data, and weather data were conducted in 3 weeks with the support of sensors. Following that, descriptive analytics, statistical and machine learning models were implemented. Ensemble models as well as single ML models would be applied.
## 🧱 Structure?
This repository contains 3 main folders:
- **data**, including:
    + raw (external data, and primary data in their rawest formats)
    + temp (temporary data sets which only function to support data processing decisions)
    + processed (filtered selected data based on study scope, study goals and data processing trials)
    + final (the data set ready for modelling)
- **src**, including: 
- **deliverables**, including:
    + project-summary (the final defense in which I summarize the whole project)  
    > **Note**  
    > For the full detailed report (study), you can email or leave a message at my LinkedIn.
- **media** (media files)
## ✌️ Result?  
The project has succeeded in detecting and estimating the number of occupants with high accuracy.  
- **Academic contributions**: The study provides a big primary dataset of occupancy, indoor air, and outdoor atmosphere. It applies insights from theories and studies on occupancy detection to a modern indoor space.  
- **Practical contributions**: The evidence of obtaining occupancy detection and classification model has been provided. Also, the study points out key issues that might help the process of developing this application.

On a more personal note, the project has received positive feedback from examiners and supervisors. Here are some of the remarks:
 > "**Fantastic work and very independent study** with detailed analysis on multiple aspects of indoor quality." 

 > "**Brilliant and precise, very professional** presentation, relevant results and smart research framework development."

## 🪁 Future?
More information about ventilation detection is required for getting the exact number in the long term.
